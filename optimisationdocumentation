Documentation Milestone 1

Followed optimization processes
First off, we started with thinking about how to translate the queries, and tried to answer the question: ‘What do these queries need to run optimally’. With this, we took the material discussed in the lectures into consideration. Methods like views were taken into account when trying to find the best optimization techniques for the queries in milestone 1.

Chosen optimization, space required for each and performance experiments with/without the optimizations
We have created some materialized views to optimize the queries:
GPA: This view contains the GPA of each studentregistration ID, which can be linked back to the StudentRegistrationToDegrees table to find the corresponding student ID’s. The view containes 2 columns of integers with the number of rows equal to the amount of studentregistration ID’s.
HighestGradeCourseOffers
StudentECTS: This view shows for each studentregistration ID how many credits the student has already obtained. This view contains 4 columns all containing integers. The number of rows are equal to the total amount of StudentRegistration ID’s.
ActiveStudentsPerDegree: This view shows the student id, the StudentRegistration ID and the Degree ID of the students who did not yet obtain the required number of degrees. The space required are 3 columns, and number of rows equal to the total amount of StudentRegistration ID’s.
DegreeCompleted: This view containes the studentregistration ID’s of those who have already completed their degree. Meaning they obtained at least the required number of ECTS for that degree. This view extends the StudentsECTS view where it checks whether the number of ECTS of that student is greater or equal to the required number of ECTS. This view is only a subset of the StudentECTS view and consists of 2 columns of integers.
NumAssistentCourseOffer: This view contains 2 columns of integers. One for the courseID and one for the count of the studentregistrationID where that count is bigger than 0
NumStudentsCourseOffer: This view offers a count of student registered for each course. Consisting of 2 columns with the length of the number of courses there are in total. Both columns contain an integer.
